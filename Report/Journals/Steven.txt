---------------------
Extensively studied motor shield data sheet with Diksha.

Friday, February 27
-------------------
Experimented with accessing current information. Broke motor shield in the process.

Saturday, February 28
---------------------
Purchased a new motor shield.
Installed new motor shield and wrote some basic code to bring us back to where we were before.
Conducted tests with motor shield. Ran into issues with erratic motor behaviour.
Researched issue of motor noise. Solved by soldering a 100 nF capacitor over each motor.
Soldered Bluetooth connections onto prototype shield.
Got Bluetooth working sucessfully.

Sunday, March 1
---------------
Added 7 links to references, mostly related to accurate navigation.
Created pinmap.txt for tracking our pin usage.
Soldered temperature/humidity sensor to prototype shield with Theresa.

Monday, March 2
---------------
Group discussion on driving the robot straight.
Found paper on 2WD, added it to referenes.
PacMan ghost group discussion.
Table Dry Erase group experiment. Added image to git.
Git documentation standardized.
Discussion with Farshid about open/closed loops.
As a group we sourced infrared input/output sensors.
Added videos to git of erratic motor behaviour before and after 100 nF capacitors added.

Tuesday, March 3
----------------
Prototyped a visual encoder demo with Anthony that ended up not being needed.
Learned how to wire up a stepper motor.
John came up with a good idea to use a wire frame and a fabric such as satin for a ghost model

Wednesday, March 4
------------------
Worked in conjunction with Logan to calculate robot voltages and currents for motors and arduino.
Occasionally assisted Anthony with controller logic.

Thursday, March 5
-----------------
(Day off for everyone)

Friday, March 6
---------------
Soldered prototype shield for controller
Assisted with the creation of the LCD mount
Assisted with the creation of the LCD display on the robot

Saturday, March 7
-----------------
Went with Theresa and we purchased fancy materials
Programmed master bluetooth module and set bluetooth modules to auto-pair to each other on power-up.
Cut controller ball in half
Cut hole in controller ball for USB
Mounted Arduino in controller ball
Mounted LCD in controller ball

Sunday, March 8
---------------
Successfully transmitted wireless messages from the robot to the controller LCD
Finally learned the software side of encoders (interrupts, etc).
Wired up Romeo board, mounted LM35 Temperature Sensor.
Reconnected Ultrasonic Rangefinder.
Cable managed the entire bottom end of the robot. Tie-wrapped wires and channeled them through a cable holder.
