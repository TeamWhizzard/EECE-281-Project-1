Started implementing sensors as well as studying data sheets of motors and all sensors
Friday, February 27
--------------------
Began using the accelerometer/gyroscope as calibration for rotation. This involved turning the motors for a given duration 
of time and integrating the degree per second data to find the total degrees turned. Using this data, we could turn
the turtle up to any given angle. Only an approximation of integration was used, by summing up (degrees per second *
delay duration). This process's accuracy could be significantly increased by lowering the delay duration to get more
gyroscope readings. This design decision was chosen over finding a magic number of time delay that could change given 
changing variables like current for the motor.

--------------------
Combined sensor code(ultrasonic and temperature) with motor code to work towards a gradual and graceful movement from 
the turtle. This involved writing code that gradually slowed down when moving towards a wall as opposed to instantaneously 
stopping. Encountered problems with the turtle not moving straight unless correcting for it with an open-circuit factor
by modifying one wheels' speed to be roughly 99% of the other's. 
Monday, March 2
--------------------
Discussed better methods in realigning turtle movement over magic numbers.
Turtle movement was inconsistent and unreliable due to constantly differing wheel speeds.
From discussion with Farshid, the group decided on adding encoders to the wheels to track number of rotations.

Tuesday, March 3
--------------------
Began creation of a technical demo of the encoders for the turtle.
Used a stepper motor and a lego wheel to simulate wheel movement on our turtle.
Attatched an infrared emitter and receiver on opposite ends of a given slit of the lego wheel.
The receiver would count the number of times it receives light through a slit, and hence the number of rotations.
By testing this functionality out first, we could then translate it over to our actual wheels where if there is a delta
in the number of rotations between each wheel, we could correct for it by proportionally speeding up one wheel for a duration of time.
