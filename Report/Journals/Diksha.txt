25th Feb:
 1. team organization, split of work, basic draft of the functionaities (desired and required), time line created
 2. Assembling the components of the Turtle together to form the basic structure  with Theresesa. 

26th Feb:
 1. studied the motor shield data with Steven
 
27th Feb: (Theresa)
  1. soldered the battery holder, which unfortunately, started smoking due to short circuit. 
  2. also, soldered other wires and parts. 

2nd Mar:(group)
  1. tested the robot, drew the routes and discussed on driving the motor straight. 

4th Mar:
  1. Built the basic circuit for encoder with John using interrupt. This was to minimize the delay as much as possible. 
  2. Wrote some code for the same. 

6th and 7th:
Read on interrupts and encoders. Read the libraries, researched on rotary motor encoders. tried building the circuit for encoder using interruptts 
but failed. 

8th:
Implemented the code. Unfortunately, read about the quadratures instead of dual encoders. But, was fnally able to write the code for retail encoder
as John was working on encoder.
