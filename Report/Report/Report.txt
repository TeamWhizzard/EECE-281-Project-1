This document serves as a complete documentation of the circuitry and functionality of the project. The project report should have sufficient detail that someone skilled in the art could reproduce or improve upon your results. Include component numbers and info, values, block diagrams, schematics, overall and detailed explanation, comments, … when necessary.
You may only include code segments in the report whenever needed for explanations. As usual you will need to submit the complete code file separately, and also to include the complete code as an appendix to this report. The code must include sufficient comments for documentation.
The number of pages for the report should be less than 10 (not including appendices), double (or 1.5) spaced, ‘Arial’ or ‘Times New Roman’ font size 11 for text, and ‘Courier New’ font size 8 or 10 for the source code, approximately one inch margin for the top, bottom, left, and right margins. It should include the following sections.
It should include the course name and number, lab section, group and bench numbers, project name, student names, and student numbers. The title page should also include an estimated percentage of participation of each group member in the project.

Introduction and motivations

In this project, we were asked to build a marketable autonomous robot that is at the very least, capable of moving straightforward at its maximum speed until it detects an object, and then decelerates gradually. It should get as close as possible to the object without hitting it.

Contributions
-------------
List and explain the contribution percentage of each team member, as well as the description of the task(s) each member worked on and completed. The sum of the individual percentages must add up to 100%. Ideally, group members should have equal participation in the project.
This estimate declaration (among other assessing points for contribution) will be used to scale the project mark to each group member. For example, assume that the estimated percentage is: Pedro 30%, John 20%, and Nancy 50% for a three-person group and the project mark is 14 out of 20, the marks will be Pedro =0.30*(14*3) = 12.6, John =0.20*(14*3) = 8.4, and Nancy=0.50*(14*3) = 20 (The mark caps at the max project grade).
Introduction and motivations
Include design objective and specifications. 
Also Include the list and description of the files submitted for this lab (including code and Fritzing breadboard schematics)

Project Description 
-------------------
This section is the main part of your project report and should have sub-headings.
Include summary of each part of and the complete lab experiment. Overview of the overall design approach including system block diagrams for both the hardware and software designs. 
Explain the design, and implementation procedures. During the lab if you selected a method over the others for any step, describe the second best alternative you considered.
Explain the evaluation/testing procedure and results. Include the problems you encounter and how to resolve them, as well as best practices you learned.
Initial Assembly: Smoke on the water
Steve and John op-tested the motors, put 36V across one, found smoke! Turns out the motors are limited to 6V. 
Decided to use one power source to power both the arduino board and the motors instead of two.  The arduino has built in device for reducing noise generated by the batteries.  We also added small capacitors parallel to the batteries to help with this.
After initially assembling the robot, threw the switch and quickly found smoke! Shut it off, had a bit of a panic, fearing we blew a motor, found out the power switch was wired wrong and was shorting the batteries.  Battery pack was fried.
Accelerometer: This thing freakin works!
Steve Anthony and Logan played with the accelerometer. 
Braking more stuff
Steve figured out we could read the voltage across each motor from one of the pins on the motor shield chip, which we wanted to factor into speed calculations.  Pin broke off the chip and best up the board :( got a new shield with voltage sensing pins already built in.
Temperature and Humidity sensor
decided to mount the temp/ humidity sensor to the board so we could factor in both humidity and temperature into our speed of sound calculations to increase the acccuracy of the distance calculations from the ultrasonic sensor.  Concluded that an excessive use of constants (ie heat capacities with limited accuracy would probably end up making little difference in the speed of sound calculation, 0.1 to 0.6% as read, or potentially worsen the results.  Went back to only using the room's temperature.  (For another reason, the blue sensor is a bit farther away from the board than the little lm35 guy would be therefore less likely to pick up heat from other components?)
